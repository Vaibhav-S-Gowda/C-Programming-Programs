# C Programming Programs

All the programs in this repository are written in the **C programming language** to demonstrate core concepts, data structures, and practice exercises.  
This repository is organized into folders based on topic and use case.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository reflects my journey in learning C programming and implementing a variety of programs, from foundational basics to data structures.
Each program reinforces practical understanding and problem‑solving skills in C, making this a useful reference for beginners and interview preparation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Data Structures/` | C implementations of fundamental data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.) |
| `Practice/` | Practice problems, exercises, and example programs in C |
| README.md | This file, providing overview and guidance |

## 🧠 Data Structures

This folder contains C programs that implement common data structures from scratch:

- **Linked List**  
  — Create, insert, delete, search, and traverse a singly linked list.
- **Stack**  
  — Push, pop, display operations using arrays or linked lists.
- **Queue**  
  — Enqueue, dequeue, and display elements.
- **Binary Tree / BST** *(if applicable)*  
  — Insert, search, and traversal algorithms.

> *Add specific file names here (e.g., `linked_list.c`, `stack_array.c`) along with short explanations.*

## 📚 Practice

This folder contains various C programs written as exercises or practice problems:

- **Basic syntax and I/O**  
  Programs demonstrating input/output, arithmetic operations, and control flow.
- **Loops and Conditions**  
  Practice with `for`, `while`, and `do‑while` loops.
- **Functions**  
  Examples showing function definition, prototypes, and return values.
- **Arrays and Strings**  
  Programs working with arrays, string manipulation, sorting, searching.
- **Recursion**  
  Recursive solutions for factorial, Fibonacci, and more.

> *List specific file names (e.g., `factorial.c`, `string_reverse.c`) with one‑line descriptions.*

## 🛠 How to Compile and Run

To compile any C program, you need a C compiler such as **GCC** installed.

### Compile a program
```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
```

### Run the executable
```bash
./outputname
```

### Example
```
gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
./linked_list
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
I plan to add:
- More advanced data structures (trees, graphs)
- Documentation and example input/output for each program
- Makefile support for easier compilation
- Unit tests for key modules
